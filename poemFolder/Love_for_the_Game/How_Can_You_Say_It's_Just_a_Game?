"How Can You Say It's Just A Game?"

    How can you say it's just a game
    When I've been pushed all my life to reach goals
    Told to work harder than my opponent
    All along being shaped and molded

    How can you say it's just a game
    When I've given blood, sweat, and tears
    Learned so many valuable lessons
    Like developing a work ethic and conquering my fears

    How can you say it's just a game
    When I've developed relationships that will last a lifetime
    Learned about self-discipline
    And how toughness is really defined

    How can you say it's just a game
    When it can bring all ethnic races together
    Working as one unit
    While pushing each other to get better

    How can you say it's just a game
    When winning and losing can determine how one feels
    Teams jerseys and colors can be seen everywhere
    And fans come to support from far and near

    How can you say it's just a game
    When it turns so many into leaders
    As well as helping to develop integrity and discipline
    And puts more attention on education and being a better reader

    How can you say it's just a game
    When coaches have to answer to alumni and bosses
    To them it's not just a game
    Because their fate is determined by wins and losses

    How can you say it's just a game
    Teams sit in the locker room and cry at the end of the season
    I guess you wouldn't understand
    Comradery would be the reason

    How can you say it's just a game
    When it can be one's passion and drive
    This thing you call just a game
    Has shaped and changed so many lives
