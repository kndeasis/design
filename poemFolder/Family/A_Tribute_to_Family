"A Tribute To Family" 

    I don't know when it started,
    Or how it all began,
    But God created families,
    As only our Lord can.

    He was teaching what it means
    To love, honor, and obey.
    He wanted a strong bond
    That we don't see too much today.

    He wanted someone to hold us
    And show respect for others.
    He wanted someone who'd be gentle,
    So he created mothers.

    He wanted someone strong,
    A support filled with love,
    So he created fathers,
    Sent from heaven up above.

    Brothers and sisters came next,
    With that, an instant friend.
    Someone to look up to,
    Someone on whom to depend.

    When he put them all together,
    He was amazed at what he'd done.
    He had created a family,
    Mother, father, daughter, son.

    But look at the family,
    Created by only two.
    How many we've become,
    And all because of you.

    We have a lot to be thankful for,
    The memories through the years.
    The many times together,
    Full of laughter, full of tears.

    I don't know where we'd be today,
    If it weren't for the two of you.
    To show us strength, support, and love,
    Like only the two of you can do.
