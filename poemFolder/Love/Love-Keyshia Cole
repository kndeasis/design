Love - Keyshia Cole 
    
    I used to think that I wasn't fine enough
    And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
    But I won't waste my time tryna figure out why you playin' games
    What's this all about?
    And I can't believe
    You're hurting me
    I met your girl, what a difference
    What you see in her
    You ain't seen in me
    But I guess it was all just make-believe
    Oh, love
    Never knew what I was missin'
    But I knew once we start kissin'
    I found
    Love
    Never knew what I was missin'
    But I knew once we start kissin'
    I found, found you
    Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
    So empty
    My heart, my soul, can't go on
    Go on, without you
    My rainy days fade away when you
    Come around, please tell me, baby
    Why you go so far away?
    Why you go?
    Love
    Never knew what I was missin'
    But I knew once we start kissin'
    I found
    Love
    Never knew what I was missin'
    But I knew once we start kissin'
    I found, I found you
    Who would have known I'd find you?
    Ooh
    Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
    So empty
    My heart, my soul, can't go on
    Go on, baby, without you
    Rainy days fade away
    When you come around
    Say you're here to stay
    With me, boy
    I don't want you to leave me
    I, I need you
    Love
    Never knew what I was missin' (I never knew)
    But I knew once we start kissin'
    I found (found love)
    Love
    Never knew what (I never) I was missin' (never, never)
    But I knew once we start kissin'
    I found (I found, I found)
    Love
    Never knew what I was missin'
    But I knew once we start kissin'
    I found
